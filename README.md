### Linting

It uses the `haml-lint` gem to lint the files.

You can configure the gem by creating a `.haml-lint.yml` file in the root of your project. Clique [here](https://github.com/sds/haml-lint/blob/main/config/default.yml) to see the default configuration.

To install the `haml-lint` gem, add the following line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'haml-lint'
end
```

### Partials - Go to definition

This feature allows you to navigate to the partial file by `CTRL + Clicking` on the partial name. Or you can right-click on the partial name and select `Go to definition`.

gem install html2haml
```

**How to use:**

1. Open the HTML or ERB file you want to convert.
2. Open the Command Palette (`CTRL + SHIFT + P`).
3. Search for `HAML: Convert HTML to HAML` and select it.
4. And await the magic!

## Configuration


You can configure the extension by creating a `.vscode/settings.json` file in the root of your project.

```ruby
{
  "hamlAll.lintEnabled": true,

  # Use 'bundle exec' to run haml-lint
  # (If this is true, the 'linterExecutablePath' setting is ignored.)
  "hamlAll.useBundler": false,

  # Path to haml-lint executable
  "hamlAll.linterExecutablePath": "haml-lint"
}
